          <h3>I have a lot of hobbies that I enjoy:</h3>
          <p>
            I like playing computer games, both online with friends and offline
            by myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also love making 3D models on my computer using a program called
            Blender.
          </p>
          <p>
            Editing photos is something I find fun, where I change pictures to
            make them look better.
          </p>
          <p>I listen to music a lot, various type of music.</p>
          <p>I really like watching TV shows and movies.</p>
          <p>
            I'm also trying to learning how to speak Spanish, which is exciting
            because it's a different language.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, sometimes I watch videos to learn about making games,
            something I hope to do in the future.
